Yes, you can **reset or change the MySQL root password** without uninstalling MySQL. Here are the common methods, depending on your access:

---

### ðŸ”’ **If you know the current root password**

You can simply change it by logging in and running:

```sql
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

---

### ðŸ”“ **If you forgot the root password**

You can **reset it by starting MySQL in safe mode** (skip-grant-tables mode):

#### ðŸ”§ Steps (Linux/macOS/WSL; similar for Windows with small changes):

1. **Stop MySQL service**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl stop mysql
   ```

2. **Start MySQL without permission checking**:

   ```bash
   sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &
   ```

3. **Log in without password**:

   ```bash
   mysql -u root
   ```

4. **Reset password**:

   ```sql
   ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   ```

5. **Exit and restart MySQL normally**:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart mysql
   ```

### ðŸªª Alternative (MySQL 5.7 and older)

Use:

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR 'root'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpassword');
```
